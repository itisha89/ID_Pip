# **Case Study: PiP's CRM Training Program for Accelerated Growth**  

## **Background**  
PiP, a European company headquartered in Brussels, is known for producing eco-diapers made entirely from recycled materials. The company operates through two business channels:  
1. **E-commerce**  
2. **Physical sales channels**, including grocery store chains and individual corner shops focusing on bio and sustainable products.  

As a buy/sell marketing organization, PiP outsources production while retaining in-house R&D capabilities. Despite achieving stable and strong year-over-year growth since its inception seven years ago, PiP aims to accelerate its growth by enhancing its understanding of market trends and customer demand.  

### **Objective**  
To improve PiP's market share in physical sales channels by implementing a new Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, enabling better customer insights and demand analysis.

- **10% with prior CRM experience**: These employees will serve as mentors.  
- **10% with limited English proficiency**: Translations and captions will aid these individuals.  
- **60% aged 40–60, with no CRM experience**: Experienced in market operations but new to CRM, requiring detailed training.  
- **20% tech-savvy younger employees**: Quick learners who will assist others.  

### **Project Timeline**  
- **Start Date**: 18-Feb-2024  
- **End Date**: 18-Aug-2024  
- **Duration**: 6 months (~130 business days, 1,040 hours)
